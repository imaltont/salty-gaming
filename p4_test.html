			    <div class="box left">
				<p> Our Google Form includes the following main sections: </p>
					<ul>
						<h4> 1 - General information about the user </h4> 
							<p> We asked the user about general information about them such as browser type, platform, internet speed and age group. This is so that we could see if they were in out target area. </p>
						<h4> 2 - Interpretation of the website </h4>
							<p> Then we asked the users to give us their impression about the use of the website. What did they think it was designed for? We also asked them about what they thought was the intended age group for the website. This is important so we can identify if the user gives a review according to his/hers age in comparison to the group we designed it for. 
						<h4> 3 - Navigation and design </h4> 
							<p> In this section we asked the users about how they think the navigation on the site worked. Was it easy to navigate? Something we could have done better? We also focused on the design and asked about the color scheme, general layout and if the user had comments regarding what could be done better. 
						<h4> 4 - General feedback </h4> 
							<p> Finally we asked if the user about the shop and if the website fulfilled its purpose. We also had a comment section for general feedback from the user. 
					</ul>

				<h3>4 - Tester Audience</h3>
				<div class="box left">
					<p>In order to receive feedback from the people in our target audience, we shared 
					the Google form we were using to gaming communities. More specific to the Starcraft 2 and Hearthstone communities.
					The forms was primarily spread through chat rooms for the respective games, and reaching out to some individuals that is within the target audience.
					This gave us an overview of how people in the targeted audience experienced the website, and could give us good feedback on how to make it better. 
					<br><br>
					We did not test it on a lot of people outside the target audience. Considering how many people were in the communities that the form was submitted through,
					the number of answers to it was disappointing, with only 11 people giving an answer, but of these, all of them (100%)
					were in the target audience. When asked about what the testing audience thought the target audience was,
					they also answered with the same as them (age 0-18 an 19-25), as the expected group of users for this page. We were not able to do any live testing.</p>
				</div>

			<div id="platforms">
				<h3>5 - Testing Platforms</h3>
				<div class="box left">
					<p> Recent windows operating systems were by far the most used by our testers with 79%. OSX, Linux and Android each getting 7%.
					Chrome was the most used browser among our tests with 61%. Firefox came second with 17%, which is a half decent sample to verify that it functions properly.
					Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera and Waterfox were each used by 6% of our testers. This is a rather narrow sample, but better than nothing.

					We should probably perform future testing on platforms other than Chrome on Windows, as these are already reasonably well tested.</p>
					<p>The site was tested with these operating systems:</p>

				<h3>6 - Feedback Summary</h3>
				<div class="box left">
					<p>The majority of the users were satisfied with the design, but a few expressed their slight dislike of the color scheme. One commented saying: "I would have changed the colors". Another said (s)he would prefer smaller fonts on the dropdown menu, smaller player portraits and a bio for each player. A few also mentioned advertisement as something they would like to see.</p>
					<img src="../../images/design.png">

					<h3>Navigation and user friendliness</h3>
					<p>The majority of users were very satisfied with the navigation and user friendliness of the website, rating the navigation an average of 8,6 points out of 10. A few additionally commented saying the navigation was simple to use and logically structured. Thus it seems that the navigation menu together with the subpage navigation overview was sufficient in providing the user with necessary navigational tools despite the lack of a proper sitemap. One person mentioned that the transparent header on the front page could cause some distraction for the navigation menu.</p>
					<img src="../../images/navigation.png">

					<h3>Shop</h3>
					<p>The feedback for the shop was more mixed, where about half and half of the users were well satisfied and not. The criticism included the lack of a shopping cart, which is something we chose to not implement due to the additional work load it would require. Also, another user mentioned that subcategories in the shop would improve the structure and make it easier to use.</p>
					<img src="../../images/shop.png">

					<h3>Purpose and goal</h3>
					<p>When asked about how well the website accomplish its purpose and goal, the majority seemed to be of the impression that it does this quite well. Only a few, about 10%, had a different opinion. Generally, the website seems to do what it is meant to do quite well, although a few tweaks and changes could potentially make the website better and further improve the user experience. With additional development time and testing, such changes could be implemented and more content could be added to continually improve the website beyond what we have had time to cover in this course.</p>

				<h3>7 - Your Response</h3>
				<div class="box left">
					<ul>
						<h3> Design</h3>
						<p>The colour scheme was one aspect of the website where opinions were split. Some really liked the colours used others disliked it heavily. We found that there was no reason to change the colour scheme based on the feedback.</p>

						<h3>Index header</h3>
						<h4>Size</h4>
						<p>The header occupies too much screen real estate. In hindsight this is especially noticeable on smaller screens were the header will cover almost all of available space.</p>
						<p>Our response would be to find a way to scale the header size, more specifically the featured box, relative to screen size.</p>
						
						<h4>Image stretching</h4>
						<p>Most likely due to its size, the featured box has a tendency to stretch the images within it making them look weird or distorted.</p>

						<p>This problem would probably be fix together with the size fix above. Use of higher resolution on images or better formatting.</p>
						
						<h4>Difficult to read or focus on the header navbar due to background images.</h4>
						
						<p>The fix here would be to either be more careful in choosing images for the featured box, the shop image seems to be the perpetrator here, or adjust the transparency of the navbar.</p>

						<h3>Shop</h3>
						<p>Complaints mentioned shop navigation relating to “T-shirt by game” and the absence of a “shopping cart”-feature making the ordering of clothes far less intuitive than it should be.</p>
							
						<p>We were aware the shop would get criticized, due to certain time constraints the shop did not turn out how we originally envisioned it. To fix this we would make the shop using php and add a shopping cart and checkout section to make the experience easier for the user. Making the shopitems responsive to the user would also go a long way in improving the shop.    
						</p>

				<h3>8 - Self-reflection</h3>
				<div class="box left">
					<p>This project taught us how time consuming and intricate group projects can be. We were mostly correct in our scheduling and timing of sub-projects with the exception of our shop feature, which we could have planned better. Generally, we gave out tasks to be completed before a soft-deadline, if a particular task turned out to be too difficult or time consuming for one member, others would chime in to help.  </p>
					<p>We believe we have more or less achieved our visual design goals for the website with only a few adjustments to some design details. If there is one thing we have learned about html and css through the course of this project is that building a well documented css framework is very important when making a website, in addition the use of the flex-feature have been a great help when it has come to the modularity of the website. </p>
					<p>For javascript we learned to be aware of browser limitations or syntax variations. The specific problem we encountered was with the use of innerhtml and how internet explorer handled it. A fix that worked on all major browsers was found and no further problems were met.</p>
